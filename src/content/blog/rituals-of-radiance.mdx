# Rituals of Radiance

The first light of the day is a quiet invitation. Begin with the **Rose Quartz Cream Cleanser**, then press in the **Silk Hydration Essence** to soften texture.

## The glow trio

1. Aurora Vitamin C Serum
2. Dew Mist Toner
3. Radiant Sun Fluid SPF 50

Complete the ritual with a veil of **Petal Blur Blush** for an effortless flush.
