# Atelier Artistry

Our makeup artists focus on light, breathable layers. Start with **Atelier Glow Primer**, then apply **Atelier Veil Foundation** only where needed.

## The soft-focus trio

- Soft Veil Concealer
- Luminous Halo Highlighter
- Cloud Matte Lip Color

The result is a polished complexion that still looks like skin.
